Dividing the wiki data into train, valid, and test sets is merely for the convenience of evaluating the performance of the classification task itself.
In downstream tasks, we use the train+valid split as the training dataset and the test set as the validation set, taking the best checkpoint from the validation set for the evaluation of downstream tasks.
